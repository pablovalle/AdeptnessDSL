1) signal with its name

2) oracle type
	- Check_Static_Upper -->Below reference (true/false inclusive bound and float bound_up)
	- Check_Static_Lower -->Above reference (true/false inclusive bound and float bound_down)
	- Check_Range--> In range reference (true/false inclusive bound, float bound_up and float bound_down)
	- Check_Gap--> In gap reference (true/false inclusive bound, float bound_up and float bound_down)

3) When speaking abour bound up and bound down, their position is compared between them. The biggest one must be bound_up and the other bound_down.
Example--> range from 1 to 10, bound_down--> 1 and bound_up-->10
Example2--> gap not to be between 1 and 10, bound_down-->1 and bound_up-->10

4) More than one signal could be created 

5) Output function name is set by the programmer
	- Ideally must be, "signalName"_"OracleType"_"OracleNumber"
	- Example--> Check_Range for first signal function is--> signal first{Check_Range first_Range_1{...}}
